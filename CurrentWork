## Things I am adding or working on

(Edited 11/12/18)

The following are features that I hope to add in the near future (in loose order)

* Support for non axis-aligned rectangular collision
* Support for circular collision
* Reworking the controller components so that input follows the Command pattern
* Adding a State Component to entities
