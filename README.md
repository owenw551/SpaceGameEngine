# SpaceGameEngine

## About
Hi! Welcome to my Game Engine Project. SpaceGameEngine is a 2D game engine that uses SDL 2.0 and implements the Component pattern. It is being worked on in my free time.

I began the project by following the incredibly helpful tutorial series called "How To Make A Game" by Carl Birch on YouTube, available at https://www.youtube.com/user/creaper/ (See below for a link to his project). His series has been on hiatus for a while now, but it served as a great introduction to how games work under the hood.

This engine is an extension and reworking of that project. Since the tutorial series stopped, I have added:  

 * Improved vector functionality 
 * a reworking of all components 
 * a scene manager
 * more advanced map functionality
 * mouse functionality
 * and more!
 
A couple of quick notes:

* I hope to keep what I am currently working on in a file called CurrentWork.
* Building and running the project at any point will most likely load up a test of the latest feature I have added, which is why the resultant program may seem a bit ... incongruous?

Feel free to use this code however you wish.

Thanks for reading!
